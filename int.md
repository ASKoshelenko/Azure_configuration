Preparing for the interview
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- One of the best ways to prepare for an interview is to interview, but it's not always practical to go on real interviews time and time again. Instead, you can use mock interviews to build your skills and increase your confidence. To get started with your mock interview, prepare a list of questions. The questions from this course should be a good start. Ask a friend or a trusted colleague to stand in as your interviewer. Make your practice environment as realistic as possible by sitting across from each other like you would in a normal interview. Then have your interviewer ask the questions that you prepared, and record your response with a mobile device or a laptop. After each session, review your responses and see where you need to make changes, like toning down nervous movements or rambling through your responses. Iterate on this until you're confident and comfortable with using positive body language and maintaining eye contact. At the beginning of each practice session, I want you to start by responding to this request, "Tell me about yourself." There's a 99.99% chance you'll be asked this question, so you need to be prepared for it. At the same time, though, I want you to not be mechanical. You may have your response memorized, but I want you to be natural in your response. Stay professional, but be comfortable with yourself and let your personality come through. First of all, smile. Smiling will put you and your interviewer at ease and also show your enthusiasm. Don't let your smile linger to the point of insanity, but use a relaxed, natural grin. Start your response by briefly summarizing your professional background. This can include your education and any specific experience you have that qualifies you for the position. Then explain your interest in the position. You can wrap up your response by sharing what you hope to contribute to the company or team if you're given the opportunity to accept the position. You want to demonstrate what you're ready and willing to offer versus what you're hoping to gain. Let's assume I'm interviewing for a position as a site reliability engineer and I'm asked to share a little bit about myself. Here's how I would respond. My name is Michael. I have a BS and MS in computer engineering from Iowa State University, go Clones, with experience in system administration and process automation. I understand that this role requires proficiency with deploying Python applications to cloud platforms, and I'm excited to learn about the types of applications you're deploying. I'm hopeful that my experience with Django and AWS will be a good fit for the position. See? That wasn't so bad, was it? I provided enough background information without repeating my resume, and I also showed that I'm interested in and qualified for the position. As you practice your tell me about yourself response, you'll get more comfortable each time. Why not start right now? Tell me about yourself. No, really, pause the video and practice right now. I'll wait. Okay, there are a few more things I want you to do before your interview. Print your resume. Even though you may have submitted your resume ahead of time, take a few more copies with you. If an interviewer needs a copy, you'll be ready to share one. Get a professional-looking binder with a notepad inside it, and make sure you have a pen. You'll be using the pen and pad to take notes during your interview. Then get some thank you cards and a book of stamps. You'll be using the notes to follow up after your interview.


Researching the opportunity
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- If you're preparing for an interview, you've probably already done some research on the opportunity. Excellent. Now I want you to take that research one step further in preparation for your interview. First, I want you to go back and look at the job description for the position you're interviewing for. Make a note of the skills and the requirements for the position, then align them with your skills and experience. It's likely that they don't match perfectly. And you know what? That's okay. First of all, you already have the interview, so someone saw it fit to contact you and set it up. And second, it's often the case that the best candidates for a job does not meet all of the requirements. Instead, the best candidates meet most of the requirements and demonstrates during their interview that they have the confidence and capability to successfully do the job as requested. So look at the job description and make notes on the requirements that you are 100% qualified for, along with the skills that you need to either improve on or can develop once you're on the job. Consider both of these in advance so you can be prepared to address any concerns your interviewer might have. Next, I want you to turn the focus back to your potential employer. Take detailed notes on the industry that the company is in and the specific product or service that they provide. I want you to know exactly how the company makes money. If an interviewer asks you, "What does our company do," you need to be prepared to answer that question as concisely as you possibly can. You should also look at financial information to get an idea of how the company is performing in their market. To the best of your ability, you should be able to determine if the company is financially sound and in a good position to bring you on as a new employee. If the company is public, you can find a lot of this information in relation to how their stock is doing. The day before your interview, search the news for any recent articles on the company. If there's any news that's a really big deal for the company, like releasing a new product or acquiring a competitor, you'll be familiar with the news and can show that you're genuinely interested in the company. As you're scheduling the interview, see if you can find out who will be conducting the interview. If you can get the name and possibly the title of the person you'll be meeting, you can take a look at their LinkedIn profile or any other publicly available information to get some details about them. Don't be invasive or disrespectful with your questions, keep it professional. And if there's something that stands out on their profile, make a note of it and ask questions specifically to that person about that topic. Now that you have this body of research on the job, the company, and possibly the people you'll be interviewing with, I want you to compile it in a notebook or a document that you can print and carry with you into the interview. I know what you're thinking. You want to keep these notes in a phone or mobile device, but don't depend on having that device available during your interview. First of all, your battery might be running low, and it'll be awkward when you ask for a place to charge your phone. And second, some interviewers may be put off 
Getting DevOps experience
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Many job descriptions for DevOps roles will mention that a certain level of experience is needed. So, you might be wondering, if I'm not in a DevOps role now, how can I get the experience I need? Surprisingly, getting the experience you need is probably easier than you think. Here are a few suggestions. First off, start where you are. Look around and find ways to apply DevOps principles. If you're a developer, learn how to deploy applications to a cloud platform. I promise you, that skill alone will make you a viable candidate. Or if you're a systems administrator, learn how to use command line tools to automate the things that you normally do manually, and learning how to apply DevOps principles shouldn't cost you very much money. Many DevOps tools are open-source, and are available for free. Also, all of the major cloud providers provide Free Tiers, that give access to their resources for up to a year. Take advantage of these free tiers to learn all you can about the resources that are available, and how to interface with them programmatically, using command line interfaces and software development kits. You can also get experience by working on open-source projects. Many of the tools that we use in DevOps come from open-source projects. These projects are often looking for contributors to help keep the code up-to-date. So, you can go to github.com and search for your favorite open-source application, and see if you can make a contribution. One of the easiest ways to get started with making open-source contributions is to update documentation. Often open-source projects will advance in functionality, but the documentation will be lagging behind. By updating the documentation, you'll not only be contributing to an open-source project, but you'll also be learning a lot about the tool and how it works. If you feel you need a verifiable type of experience, I would suggest that you do Pro Bono work. Nonprofit organizations in your community, and national organizations like the Taproot Foundation are constantly searching for professionals to volunteer their skills and time to provide technical solutions. Also, the benefit of working with a public nonprofit is that, if the solution is something you can share publicly, like a website or a mobile application, for example, you can add that to your portfolio and share it with potential employers. And finally, I suggest that you keep a blog or some sort of developer diary about the skills that you're learning. If it's a blog that's publicly accessible, add it to your portfolio and share it with potential employers as an example of your ability to document technical solutions and to show your growth as an engineer Even if you don't have a day job where you're practicing a DevOps methodology on a day-to-day basis, use these methods to build a base of experience that demonstrates your ability to learn and apply DevOps tools and concepts.


Certifications
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- As you prepare to interview for a DevOps role, you may be asking yourself is the certification really necessary? Before I answer that question let's briefly discuss certifications in general. This is one of my favorite definitions for certification. Certification signifies that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain vocational subject. In other words, it's a formal recognition that you demonstrated a comprehension of a specific body of knowledge. There are hundreds of certifications that are applicable for DevOps roles, but if you were to group them into categories, they are essentially technology based and skill-based. Technology certifications show that you know how to use some specific type of software or an application. And skill-based certifications show that you have experience or some proficiency with a particular skill like programming or project management. Regardless of the type of certification, there's usually two steps to becoming certified. The first step is taking some type of training or doing some independent study, and the second step is taking some sort of examination. This could be a multiple choice exam where you answer questions and get scored based on the number of correct answers that you provided, or it could be some sort of proficiency exam where you actually have to demonstrate a skill or solve problems using the knowledge that's being certified. Now, let me give you my answer to your question, is certification really necessary? Yes, I do believe it is for these reasons. Certifications are administered by third parties, and by that I mean someone other than you and the employer. So this gives credibility to your skills and knowledge based on this third party verification. Having a certification increases your visibility in the industry. If you're among a group of peers and you're the only one that's certified, you instantly stand out from the pack. This can open up new career opportunities. And finally, I think acquiring certification shows personal initiative and demonstrates a commitment to your craft. If it's not a requirement for you to have a certification but you go out and get one anyway, then that takes a special sort of fortitude to want something, go through the steps to acquire it, and eventually achieve it. And when you're interviewing for a job, that accomplishment can speak volumes about your qualifications as a candidate for the position without you having to say anything. Simply put, your certification can speak for itself. Now, the perfect follow-up question is, what certification should I get? The answer to this depends largely on the role that you're interviewing for and your own personal career plan. So I won't advise you on one certification over another. You have to make that decision for yourself. But if you're interested in a DevOps role, I would advise you on a few types of certifications you can consider. All of the major cloud service providers issue certifications that validate knowledge about the services they provide. So if you are interviewing for a company that has a large footprint in AWS, you might consider the AWS Certified Solutions Architect or Certified CIS ops Engineer certificates. And the same is true for certificates with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Regardless of your background and regardless of your role in a DevOps organization, I think that everyone should have some sort of cloud certification to prove that they, first of all understand the benefits of cloud, and second, know how to use it to a company's advantage. Operating systems have a big impact on the way that we run and manage software, so getting certified in an operating system like Red Hat Linux for example, exposes you to specific details on how to use the resources that an operating system provides. You often see different levels of operating system certifications with architect being the top level. Attaining that level can be ideal if you would like to go into cloud architecture or system architecture, because knowing the operating system as a foundation goes a long way in building solutions that are reliable and optimal. And finally, you can get certified in specific tools. Now, I'm hesitant to suggest getting certified in any one tool. There are so many tools in the DevOp space that you can easily become overwhelmed wondering which tool certification is the right one for you. Also, DevOps tools change so frequently, the tool you get certified for today may not be the best tool for the job a year from now. However, if you force me to answer, "Which tool is the most important," I still won't say one specific tool, but I would suggest tools that enable application deployments, configuration management, and I would further narrow that to include tools that work effectively with container-based applications.


Methods for answering questions
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Throughout this course, I'll be coaching you on how you can answer actual interview questions. My goal is for you to be able to answer questions concisely and confidently to impress upon the interviewer that you are the best person for the job. To achieve this, I'll show you how to use four methods for answering interview questions that have been successful for me throughout my career. The definition method, the THX method, the story time method, and the show-and-tell method. First up is the definition method. During your interview, you may get a question like, what is x? Or even more directly, how do you define this term? This is a clear call for using the definition method. With the definition method, you are going to have to recall the information needed to define whatever it is you're being questioned on. Now, it's difficult to show expertise when you're simply offering a definition. Anyone can memorize things and recall them when prompted. So to show that you're the best person for the job, you need to combine the definition method with another method. Next is THX, an acronym that I use for time, how, and experience. Time is for the amount of time you've consistently done something, like for example, the number of years you've used a particular tool. The H is for how you've used, or applied something like how you used a tool, or a concept, and the X is for experience. This backs up the time and how with the story, describing your experience using the tool or concept. And yes, I know experience starts with an e, but the x sound fits with THX so much better, and it's easy to remember. Next up is one of my favorite methods, story time. One of the best ways to approach answering a question is to tell a story. Like any good story, yours should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning should describe the initial state, how things were before anything changed. You can close out the beginning by describing the change that prompts some action. The middle describes decisions you've made based on actions you took, based on the change. Those actions and decisions should naturally lead to a conclusion. At the end of your story, you want to focus on results. This is your opportunity to show how the actions you took, or the decisions you made led to beneficial results for your team, the company you work for, or your career. Last but definitely not least, we have the show-and-tell method. This method can be combined with any other prior methods to visually demonstrate the concept that you're explaining or the story you're telling. The show-and-tell method is useful for things like architectural diagrams, flow charts, or describing the relation between objects in a system. And while many people dread or even frown on whiteboarding in interviews, using the show-and-tell method you can demonstrate your confidence and expertise in a situation where many people struggle. As we go over different questions in the course, I'll show you how to use these methods to align your responses with the interest of the interviewer and the requirements of the position you're interviewing for.





Defining DevOps
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- How do you define DevOps and what does DevOps mean to you? - This may be one of the earlier questions you get in your interview because it sets the tone for the rest of the discussion. Your understanding of DevOps and its core ties into the parts that make up DevOps as a whole. The best approach to answering this question is to use the definition method. Fortunately, the forefathers of DevOps gave us a great acronym to use when defining DevOps CAMS or cams, which stands for Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing. Try to remember this acronym and use the parts that make it up to round out your answer. Culture is a result of the way that teams interact. In DevOps culture, the aim is to have development and operations teams interact in a way that breaks down barriers between the teams and with a clear focus on the roles and responsibilities of each. With both teams working towards a common goal, everyone wins. Automation is used to speed up the feedback between teams. By using tools that enable collaboration and repeatable processes, interaction between development and operations teams can be easily facilitated. This builds confidence in both teams' ability to successfully deliver a product or solution. Some key points for automation include revision control with pull requests, continuous integration, and configuration management. Measure is used to track improvement. By measuring aspects of development and operations teams can start to see where there are bottlenecks and take actions to improve them. Measuring the performance of production systems is also key. This helps teams to know that deployments have not degraded anything like response time, for example. Last up is sharing. Sharing allows for cross-pollination of ideas, problems and solutions between various teams, and not just in development and operations but throughout the entire organization. By transferring knowledge, the collective intelligence increases and benefits everyone. It also contributes to diversity of thought, transparency, and openness, which makes for teams that are more effective. When you're defining DevOps, it's important to not focus on any one particular tool or technology. Instead, focus on how DevOps is a way of thinking and can be applied in different types of organizations with different types of tools. However, the ideas behind culture, automation, measurement, and sharing remain the same.

Lean vs. agile vs. DevOps
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- In your opinion, what are the differences between lean software development, agile software development, and DevOps? - You're likely to get this question if you're interviewing for a job that's closely aligned with software development. The best approach is to use the definition method to define lean and agile before offering a comparison. Lean is an approach to software development focused on optimizing development resources with the initial goal of delivering a minimum viable product, also known as an MVP. Once the MVP is released to market, the development team takes feedback from the product users and adds, removes or improves features based on what's best for the customer. Agile is actually a framework for multiple approaches to project management. The Scrum approach is the one that's most often referred to. Using this method, development teams work on application features in two-week periods called sprints. During each sprint, the development team uses input from the business or feedback from end users to add specific features or repair bugs. At the end of the sprint, a new version of the application may be released along with a deployment to production. Now that we've defined lean and agile, we can complete our answer by comparing them to DevOps. You can simplify by limiting your response to just two or three differences and similarities. For example, communication, operations and flexibility. In lean and agile approaches, the development team communicates with end users or business stakeholders. As a result, a virtual wall is built between the team developing the software and the team operating it in production. Using a DevOps approach, the focus is on collaboration, so all teams are involved. Also with DevOps, all teams participate in operating the application. If a problem happens in production, it's likely that operations and development teams will chip in to resolve the issue. This may not be the case for teams that focus purely on lean or agile approaches. And lastly, lean and agile teams iterate based on feedback but keeping deployments to strict sprints or scheduled releases may prevent features from being deployed in response to problems that are currently affecting performance in the production environment. The DevOps approach, on the other hand, seeks to maintain a capability to continuously monitor and respond to changes that negatively impact the software in production. Of course, there are other differences and similarities you could discuss. If you can, learn which approach is used by the team you're interviewing with. Learn more about that approach and factor your research into your response.

Configuration management
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- What configuration tools are you most familiar with, and how have you used them? - This question is used to gauge your experience with configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. You can start answering this question with a definition method to explain how configuration management tools are an important part of DevOps, because they assist with automation tasks in the DevOps lifecycle. You can even offer some differences between Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. Then finish your answer with the THX method. Of course, your response will vary based on the configuration management tools you have experience with. Let's start with a quick definition and comparison of these tools. Chef and Puppet are usually deployed with a master node that manages a collection of client nodes. The master uses agents running on each client to communicate and enforce the client's configuration. The client nodes communicate with a master node on a regular schedule, pulling any updates to their configuration each time. Ansible, on the other hand, doesn't use a master server and instead runs from a control node that communicates with client nodes over SSH. The desired configuration is pushed to the client only when initiated by the end user. Both Chef and Puppet use a domain-specific language based on Ruby for their configurations. Ansible uses a YAML format for configurations. Generally speaking, Chef and Puppet are a bit more involved to set up, mainly because the setup involves installing agents on each client node. Because Ansible doesn't require an agent on the client, set-up is relatively easy. Now we can finish answering the question using the THX method. I'll answer by focusing on my experience with Ansible and Chef. Again, your response will be different based on the configuration management tools you've used. I've used Ansible for several years now, and Chef for the past three years. During that time, I've used Ansible to simplify web deployments for Django applications, and I've used Chef to manage large installations of servers running in an on-premises data center. I really appreciate Ansible for its YAML-based playbooks. They're clear enough that the intention of a playbook can be easily understood by less technical team members. If you know the team you're interviewing with is using a tool you don't have experience with, focus on your configuration management skills that are transferrable, like describing desired state with software. Also, learn more about the tool before the interview so you're familiar enough

Solution
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
(upbeat music) - This challenge is designed to test your knowledge of the DevOps lifecycle and all things continuous, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. The best approach to answering this question is the show and tell method. As you're showing your diagram, be sure to think out loud so your interviewer can follow your train of thought. Okay, let's build this pipeline. I'm going to start on the left hand side, and extend the pipeline out to the right. First thing I want to represent is the code repository, and also a user out here. So what's going to happen is the user is going to push a change in the repository, and that's going to trigger the build process. I'll write trigger right here, and this kicks off the CICD pipeline. The first thing that the pipeline is going to do is check out the code. This'll be the latest version that the developer just checked in, so we'll be working with the latest and greatest code. Next, we'll run some really quick tests on just the code by itself. We'll do some linting and some unit tests just to make sure that the code is valid, and no syntax errors have been introduced into the code since the last build. And the next step will actually build the container image. So I'll label this stage as build and indicate that this is where the docker build command would run. Once the image is created, we can run tests on it. So I would label the next stage as test, and in this stage I would run the container image, and I'll call this docker run. This run would be a simple command against the new container image, just to validate that the application and the build are both correct. Once the container image has been validated we can store it, so in the next stage, which I will label as store, I would push the container image up to an image registry like Docker Hub, where it can be retrieved for usage later. So far, we're at the point where we've implemented continuous integration and continuous delivery. If this was a continuous deployment pipeline, then we can add a couple more stages. The first one would be a deploy stage that uses the image that was just built, and pushes it to an actual production server. And the last stage would run some quick tests against that production server, just to make sure that the deployment didn't break anything, or cause some unexpected problems on the server. Don't feel pressured to deliver the perfect solution. Instead, show that you can explain the main concepts clearly and concisely.

Preparing for the interview
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- One of the best ways to prepare for an interview is to interview, but it's not always practical to go on real interviews time and time again. Instead, you can use mock interviews to build your skills and increase your confidence. To get started with your mock interview, prepare a list of questions. The questions from this course should be a good start. Ask a friend or a trusted colleague to stand in as your interviewer. Make your practice environment as realistic as possible by sitting across from each other like you would in a normal interview. Then have your interviewer ask the questions that you prepared, and record your response with a mobile device or a laptop. After each session, review your responses and see where you need to make changes, like toning down nervous movements or rambling through your responses. Iterate on this until you're confident and comfortable with using positive body language and maintaining eye contact. At the beginning of each practice session, I want you to start by responding to this request, "Tell me about yourself." There's a 99.99% chance you'll be asked this question, so you need to be prepared for it. At the same time, though, I want you to not be mechanical. You may have your response memorized, but I want you to be natural in your response. Stay professional, but be comfortable with yourself and let your personality come through. First of all, smile. Smiling will put you and your interviewer at ease and also show your enthusiasm. Don't let your smile linger to the point of insanity, but use a relaxed, natural grin. Start your response by briefly summarizing your professional background. This can include your education and any specific experience you have that qualifies you for the position. Then explain your interest in the position. You can wrap up your response by sharing what you hope to contribute to the company or team if you're given the opportunity to accept the position. You want to demonstrate what you're ready and willing to offer versus what you're hoping to gain. Let's assume I'm interviewing for a position as a site reliability engineer and I'm asked to share a little bit about myself. Here's how I would respond. My name is Michael. I have a BS and MS in computer engineering from Iowa State University, go Clones, with experience in system administration and process automation. I understand that this role requires proficiency with deploying Python applications to cloud platforms, and I'm excited to learn about the types of applications you're deploying. I'm hopeful that my experience with Django and AWS will be a good fit for the position. See? That wasn't so bad, was it? I provided enough background information without repeating my resume, and I also showed that I'm interested in and qualified for the position. As you practice your tell me about yourself response, you'll get more comfortable each time. Why not start right now? Tell me about yourself. No, really, pause the video and practice right now. I'll wait. Okay, there are a few more things I want you to do before your interview. Print your resume. Even though you may have submitted your resume ahead of time, take a few more copies with you. If an interviewer needs a copy, you'll be ready to share one. Get a professional-looking binder with a notepad inside it, and make sure you have a pen. You'll be using the pen and pad to take notes during your interview. Then get some thank you cards and a book of stamps. You'll be using the notes to follow up after your interview.


Researching the opportunity
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- If you're preparing for an interview, you've probably already done some research on the opportunity. Excellent. Now I want you to take that research one step further in preparation for your interview. First, I want you to go back and look at the job description for the position you're interviewing for. Make a note of the skills and the requirements for the position, then align them with your skills and experience. It's likely that they don't match perfectly. And you know what? That's okay. First of all, you already have the interview, so someone saw it fit to contact you and set it up. And second, it's often the case that the best candidates for a job does not meet all of the requirements. Instead, the best candidates meet most of the requirements and demonstrates during their interview that they have the confidence and capability to successfully do the job as requested. So look at the job description and make notes on the requirements that you are 100% qualified for, along with the skills that you need to either improve on or can develop once you're on the job. Consider both of these in advance so you can be prepared to address any concerns your interviewer might have. Next, I want you to turn the focus back to your potential employer. Take detailed notes on the industry that the company is in and the specific product or service that they provide. I want you to know exactly how the company makes money. If an interviewer asks you, "What does our company do," you need to be prepared to answer that question as concisely as you possibly can. You should also look at financial information to get an idea of how the company is performing in their market. To the best of your ability, you should be able to determine if the company is financially sound and in a good position to bring you on as a new employee. If the company is public, you can find a lot of this information in relation to how their stock is doing. The day before your interview, search the news for any recent articles on the company. If there's any news that's a really big deal for the company, like releasing a new product or acquiring a competitor, you'll be familiar with the news and can show that you're genuinely interested in the company. As you're scheduling the interview, see if you can find out who will be conducting the interview. If you can get the name and possibly the title of the person you'll be meeting, you can take a look at their LinkedIn profile or any other publicly available information to get some details about them. Don't be invasive or disrespectful with your questions, keep it professional. And if there's something that stands out on their profile, make a note of it and ask questions specifically to that person about that topic. Now that you have this body of research on the job, the company, and possibly the people you'll be interviewing with, I want you to compile it in a notebook or a document that you can print and carry with you into the interview. I know what you're thinking. You want to keep these notes in a phone or mobile device, but don't depend on having that device available during your interview. First of all, your battery might be running low, and it'll be awkward when you ask for a place to charge your phone. And second, some interviewers may be put off 
Getting DevOps experience
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Many job descriptions for DevOps roles will mention that a certain level of experience is needed. So, you might be wondering, if I'm not in a DevOps role now, how can I get the experience I need? Surprisingly, getting the experience you need is probably easier than you think. Here are a few suggestions. First off, start where you are. Look around and find ways to apply DevOps principles. If you're a developer, learn how to deploy applications to a cloud platform. I promise you, that skill alone will make you a viable candidate. Or if you're a systems administrator, learn how to use command line tools to automate the things that you normally do manually, and learning how to apply DevOps principles shouldn't cost you very much money. Many DevOps tools are open-source, and are available for free. Also, all of the major cloud providers provide Free Tiers, that give access to their resources for up to a year. Take advantage of these free tiers to learn all you can about the resources that are available, and how to interface with them programmatically, using command line interfaces and software development kits. You can also get experience by working on open-source projects. Many of the tools that we use in DevOps come from open-source projects. These projects are often looking for contributors to help keep the code up-to-date. So, you can go to github.com and search for your favorite open-source application, and see if you can make a contribution. One of the easiest ways to get started with making open-source contributions is to update documentation. Often open-source projects will advance in functionality, but the documentation will be lagging behind. By updating the documentation, you'll not only be contributing to an open-source project, but you'll also be learning a lot about the tool and how it works. If you feel you need a verifiable type of experience, I would suggest that you do Pro Bono work. Nonprofit organizations in your community, and national organizations like the Taproot Foundation are constantly searching for professionals to volunteer their skills and time to provide technical solutions. Also, the benefit of working with a public nonprofit is that, if the solution is something you can share publicly, like a website or a mobile application, for example, you can add that to your portfolio and share it with potential employers. And finally, I suggest that you keep a blog or some sort of developer diary about the skills that you're learning. If it's a blog that's publicly accessible, add it to your portfolio and share it with potential employers as an example of your ability to document technical solutions and to show your growth as an engineer Even if you don't have a day job where you're practicing a DevOps methodology on a day-to-day basis, use these methods to build a base of experience that demonstrates your ability to learn and apply DevOps tools and concepts.


Certifications
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- As you prepare to interview for a DevOps role, you may be asking yourself is the certification really necessary? Before I answer that question let's briefly discuss certifications in general. This is one of my favorite definitions for certification. Certification signifies that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain vocational subject. In other words, it's a formal recognition that you demonstrated a comprehension of a specific body of knowledge. There are hundreds of certifications that are applicable for DevOps roles, but if you were to group them into categories, they are essentially technology based and skill-based. Technology certifications show that you know how to use some specific type of software or an application. And skill-based certifications show that you have experience or some proficiency with a particular skill like programming or project management. Regardless of the type of certification, there's usually two steps to becoming certified. The first step is taking some type of training or doing some independent study, and the second step is taking some sort of examination. This could be a multiple choice exam where you answer questions and get scored based on the number of correct answers that you provided, or it could be some sort of proficiency exam where you actually have to demonstrate a skill or solve problems using the knowledge that's being certified. Now, let me give you my answer to your question, is certification really necessary? Yes, I do believe it is for these reasons. Certifications are administered by third parties, and by that I mean someone other than you and the employer. So this gives credibility to your skills and knowledge based on this third party verification. Having a certification increases your visibility in the industry. If you're among a group of peers and you're the only one that's certified, you instantly stand out from the pack. This can open up new career opportunities. And finally, I think acquiring certification shows personal initiative and demonstrates a commitment to your craft. If it's not a requirement for you to have a certification but you go out and get one anyway, then that takes a special sort of fortitude to want something, go through the steps to acquire it, and eventually achieve it. And when you're interviewing for a job, that accomplishment can speak volumes about your qualifications as a candidate for the position without you having to say anything. Simply put, your certification can speak for itself. Now, the perfect follow-up question is, what certification should I get? The answer to this depends largely on the role that you're interviewing for and your own personal career plan. So I won't advise you on one certification over another. You have to make that decision for yourself. But if you're interested in a DevOps role, I would advise you on a few types of certifications you can consider. All of the major cloud service providers issue certifications that validate knowledge about the services they provide. So if you are interviewing for a company that has a large footprint in AWS, you might consider the AWS Certified Solutions Architect or Certified CIS ops Engineer certificates. And the same is true for certificates with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Regardless of your background and regardless of your role in a DevOps organization, I think that everyone should have some sort of cloud certification to prove that they, first of all understand the benefits of cloud, and second, know how to use it to a company's advantage. Operating systems have a big impact on the way that we run and manage software, so getting certified in an operating system like Red Hat Linux for example, exposes you to specific details on how to use the resources that an operating system provides. You often see different levels of operating system certifications with architect being the top level. Attaining that level can be ideal if you would like to go into cloud architecture or system architecture, because knowing the operating system as a foundation goes a long way in building solutions that are reliable and optimal. And finally, you can get certified in specific tools. Now, I'm hesitant to suggest getting certified in any one tool. There are so many tools in the DevOp space that you can easily become overwhelmed wondering which tool certification is the right one for you. Also, DevOps tools change so frequently, the tool you get certified for today may not be the best tool for the job a year from now. However, if you force me to answer, "Which tool is the most important," I still won't say one specific tool, but I would suggest tools that enable application deployments, configuration management, and I would further narrow that to include tools that work effectively with container-based applications.


Methods for answering questions
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Throughout this course, I'll be coaching you on how you can answer actual interview questions. My goal is for you to be able to answer questions concisely and confidently to impress upon the interviewer that you are the best person for the job. To achieve this, I'll show you how to use four methods for answering interview questions that have been successful for me throughout my career. The definition method, the THX method, the story time method, and the show-and-tell method. First up is the definition method. During your interview, you may get a question like, what is x? Or even more directly, how do you define this term? This is a clear call for using the definition method. With the definition method, you are going to have to recall the information needed to define whatever it is you're being questioned on. Now, it's difficult to show expertise when you're simply offering a definition. Anyone can memorize things and recall them when prompted. So to show that you're the best person for the job, you need to combine the definition method with another method. Next is THX, an acronym that I use for time, how, and experience. Time is for the amount of time you've consistently done something, like for example, the number of years you've used a particular tool. The H is for how you've used, or applied something like how you used a tool, or a concept, and the X is for experience. This backs up the time and how with the story, describing your experience using the tool or concept. And yes, I know experience starts with an e, but the x sound fits with THX so much better, and it's easy to remember. Next up is one of my favorite methods, story time. One of the best ways to approach answering a question is to tell a story. Like any good story, yours should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning should describe the initial state, how things were before anything changed. You can close out the beginning by describing the change that prompts some action. The middle describes decisions you've made based on actions you took, based on the change. Those actions and decisions should naturally lead to a conclusion. At the end of your story, you want to focus on results. This is your opportunity to show how the actions you took, or the decisions you made led to beneficial results for your team, the company you work for, or your career. Last but definitely not least, we have the show-and-tell method. This method can be combined with any other prior methods to visually demonstrate the concept that you're explaining or the story you're telling. The show-and-tell method is useful for things like architectural diagrams, flow charts, or describing the relation between objects in a system. And while many people dread or even frown on whiteboarding in interviews, using the show-and-tell method you can demonstrate your confidence and expertise in a situation where many people struggle. As we go over different questions in the course, I'll show you how to use these methods to align your responses with the interest of the interviewer and the requirements of the position you're interviewing for.





Defining DevOps
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- How do you define DevOps and what does DevOps mean to you? - This may be one of the earlier questions you get in your interview because it sets the tone for the rest of the discussion. Your understanding of DevOps and its core ties into the parts that make up DevOps as a whole. The best approach to answering this question is to use the definition method. Fortunately, the forefathers of DevOps gave us a great acronym to use when defining DevOps CAMS or cams, which stands for Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing. Try to remember this acronym and use the parts that make it up to round out your answer. Culture is a result of the way that teams interact. In DevOps culture, the aim is to have development and operations teams interact in a way that breaks down barriers between the teams and with a clear focus on the roles and responsibilities of each. With both teams working towards a common goal, everyone wins. Automation is used to speed up the feedback between teams. By using tools that enable collaboration and repeatable processes, interaction between development and operations teams can be easily facilitated. This builds confidence in both teams' ability to successfully deliver a product or solution. Some key points for automation include revision control with pull requests, continuous integration, and configuration management. Measure is used to track improvement. By measuring aspects of development and operations teams can start to see where there are bottlenecks and take actions to improve them. Measuring the performance of production systems is also key. This helps teams to know that deployments have not degraded anything like response time, for example. Last up is sharing. Sharing allows for cross-pollination of ideas, problems and solutions between various teams, and not just in development and operations but throughout the entire organization. By transferring knowledge, the collective intelligence increases and benefits everyone. It also contributes to diversity of thought, transparency, and openness, which makes for teams that are more effective. When you're defining DevOps, it's important to not focus on any one particular tool or technology. Instead, focus on how DevOps is a way of thinking and can be applied in different types of organizations with different types of tools. However, the ideas behind culture, automation, measurement, and sharing remain the same.

Lean vs. agile vs. DevOps
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- In your opinion, what are the differences between lean software development, agile software development, and DevOps? - You're likely to get this question if you're interviewing for a job that's closely aligned with software development. The best approach is to use the definition method to define lean and agile before offering a comparison. Lean is an approach to software development focused on optimizing development resources with the initial goal of delivering a minimum viable product, also known as an MVP. Once the MVP is released to market, the development team takes feedback from the product users and adds, removes or improves features based on what's best for the customer. Agile is actually a framework for multiple approaches to project management. The Scrum approach is the one that's most often referred to. Using this method, development teams work on application features in two-week periods called sprints. During each sprint, the development team uses input from the business or feedback from end users to add specific features or repair bugs. At the end of the sprint, a new version of the application may be released along with a deployment to production. Now that we've defined lean and agile, we can complete our answer by comparing them to DevOps. You can simplify by limiting your response to just two or three differences and similarities. For example, communication, operations and flexibility. In lean and agile approaches, the development team communicates with end users or business stakeholders. As a result, a virtual wall is built between the team developing the software and the team operating it in production. Using a DevOps approach, the focus is on collaboration, so all teams are involved. Also with DevOps, all teams participate in operating the application. If a problem happens in production, it's likely that operations and development teams will chip in to resolve the issue. This may not be the case for teams that focus purely on lean or agile approaches. And lastly, lean and agile teams iterate based on feedback but keeping deployments to strict sprints or scheduled releases may prevent features from being deployed in response to problems that are currently affecting performance in the production environment. The DevOps approach, on the other hand, seeks to maintain a capability to continuously monitor and respond to changes that negatively impact the software in production. Of course, there are other differences and similarities you could discuss. If you can, learn which approach is used by the team you're interviewing with. Learn more about that approach and factor your research into your response.

Configuration management
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- What configuration tools are you most familiar with, and how have you used them? - This question is used to gauge your experience with configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. You can start answering this question with a definition method to explain how configuration management tools are an important part of DevOps, because they assist with automation tasks in the DevOps lifecycle. You can even offer some differences between Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. Then finish your answer with the THX method. Of course, your response will vary based on the configuration management tools you have experience with. Let's start with a quick definition and comparison of these tools. Chef and Puppet are usually deployed with a master node that manages a collection of client nodes. The master uses agents running on each client to communicate and enforce the client's configuration. The client nodes communicate with a master node on a regular schedule, pulling any updates to their configuration each time. Ansible, on the other hand, doesn't use a master server and instead runs from a control node that communicates with client nodes over SSH. The desired configuration is pushed to the client only when initiated by the end user. Both Chef and Puppet use a domain-specific language based on Ruby for their configurations. Ansible uses a YAML format for configurations. Generally speaking, Chef and Puppet are a bit more involved to set up, mainly because the setup involves installing agents on each client node. Because Ansible doesn't require an agent on the client, set-up is relatively easy. Now we can finish answering the question using the THX method. I'll answer by focusing on my experience with Ansible and Chef. Again, your response will be different based on the configuration management tools you've used. I've used Ansible for several years now, and Chef for the past three years. During that time, I've used Ansible to simplify web deployments for Django applications, and I've used Chef to manage large installations of servers running in an on-premises data center. I really appreciate Ansible for its YAML-based playbooks. They're clear enough that the intention of a playbook can be easily understood by less technical team members. If you know the team you're interviewing with is using a tool you don't have experience with, focus on your configuration management skills that are transferrable, like describing desired state with software. Also, learn more about the tool before the interview so you're familiar enough

Challenge

(bright music) - Our development team wants to move one of our applications from a server-based deployment to a container-based deployment. How would you diagram a CI/CD pipeline for creating the container image and deploying it to our production environment? - Our development team wants to move one of our applications from a server-based deployment to a container-based deployment. How would you diagram a CI/CD pipeline for creating the container image and deploying it to a production environment? Okay, it's time for show and tell. Take a moment to consider this challenge and then take a shot at developing your own solution. Once you're done, move on to the solution in the next video.

Solution
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
(upbeat music) - This challenge is designed to test your knowledge of the DevOps lifecycle and all things continuous, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. The best approach to answering this question is the show and tell method. As you're showing your diagram, be sure to think out loud so your interviewer can follow your train of thought. Okay, let's build this pipeline. I'm going to start on the left hand side, and extend the pipeline out to the right. First thing I want to represent is the code repository, and also a user out here. So what's going to happen is the user is going to push a change in the repository, and that's going to trigger the build process. I'll write trigger right here, and this kicks off the CICD pipeline. The first thing that the pipeline is going to do is check out the code. This'll be the latest version that the developer just checked in, so we'll be working with the latest and greatest code. Next, we'll run some really quick tests on just the code by itself. We'll do some linting and some unit tests just to make sure that the code is valid, and no syntax errors have been introduced into the code since the last build. And the next step will actually build the container image. So I'll label this stage as build and indicate that this is where the docker build command would run. Once the image is created, we can run tests on it. So I would label the next stage as test, and in this stage I would run the container image, and I'll call this docker run. This run would be a simple command against the new container image, just to validate that the application and the build are both correct. Once the container image has been validated we can store it, so in the next stage, which I will label as store, I would push the container image up to an image registry like Docker Hub, where it can be retrieved for usage later. So far, we're at the point where we've implemented continuous integration and continuous delivery. If this was a continuous deployment pipeline, then we can add a couple more stages. The first one would be a deploy stage that uses the image that was just built, and pushes it to an actual production server. And the last stage would run some quick tests against that production server, just to make sure that the deployment didn't break anything, or cause some unexpected problems on the server. Don't feel pressured to deliver the perfect solution. Instead, show that you can explain the main concepts clearly and concisely.

Operating systems

- Tell me about your experience with Linux and Windows operating systems. - Being a hardcore system administrator isn't always a requirement for a role focused on DevOps. However, having experience with server and desktop operating systems can go a long way when you're working with tools and applications used for development and operations. You can effectively answer questions like this by researching the role you're interviewing for and sharing a story that describes your experience. Generally speaking, if you're interviewing for a role working with Enterprise applications, then you need to be ready to answer questions about Windows Server or some other Windows-based operating system. On the other hand, if you're interviewing for a role that deals with web or mobile applications, you should be ready to answer questions about Linux operating systems. And in either case, you should be prepared to answer questions about your use of desktop and laptop systems, running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. Let's use the THX method to answer this question. First, provide the amount of time you've used an operating system in months or years. Then give a specific example of how you've used the operating system, and finally share a story describing your experience using the operating system. Let's see a demonstration on answering this question. I'll focus my answer on my experience with Linux and MacOS. I've been using Linux and Mac OS for many years now. I've used MacOS as a desktop operating system, mainly because the tools I need for scripting and connecting to remote systems are readily available on that platform. On the server side, I've worked with servers running Red Hat, CentOS, and Ubuntu. On those servers, I've installed and maintained web servers, database servers, and DNS servers among other applications. I really enjoy using Ubuntu Linux because installing packages is an enjoyable process. Compared to Red Hat and CentOS systems, I've had a much easier time getting applications to run on Ubuntu right out of the box. What you really want to convey is how your past experience makes you the best candidate for the role you're interviewing for. As much as you possibly can, tie your past experiences directly to requirements for the job.


Command line tools
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Why is it important to know how to use command line tools in a DevOps role? - Here are the THX targets. Describe how long you've been using command line tools, give examples of the way you've used those tools and then share what your experience has been. Here's an example that uses the THX approach. I've been using command line tools for more than 20 years now. I've used them to generate reports, process data and interact with remote systems. I appreciate that even though I've changed jobs or roles, the command line tools have remained the same. For example, I started out learning how to use command line tools on Linux systems. From there, I transitioned to Windows systems. Many years later, I started using the Mac operating system for the first time. It was a really foreign environment for me because I was so used to working on Windows. But one thing I found was that the Mac terminal was the same as the Unix and Linux terminal that I was so familiar with. So starting with the command line, I was able to get familiar with Macs very quickly. Now you can transition into the definition method to round out your answer to the question. Using the definition approach, target topics that fit DevOps roles, for example commonality. Most systems today, even if they have a graphical user interface, also have a command line. So becoming familiar with command line tools and command line interfaces on one system immediately makes you effective on another system. Scale. Graphical and web-based interfaces can be used for many DevOps tasks, but operating at scale requires a solid grasp for the command line. For example, you may need to make a change on thousands of systems, and doing that through a web interface could be tedious and error prone. However, you can use a variety of command line tools to affect change on all those same systems with just one command. And finally, speed comes into play. Sometimes it's just quicker to hack something out in a terminal than to poke around in a user interface. You might also be wondering what sort of command line tools should you be familiar with. First and foremost, you should be familiar with commands that extract information from your system. If you're running on Unix, Linux or Windows systems, using command line tools to get information like CPU, memory and disk space utilization are useful for debugging and determining the status of a system. So you need to be familiar with tools like top, to show system statistics, free to show memory utilization, df to show file system details, including storage utilization and ps to show what processes are running. These commands are applicable on Unix and Linux file systems, but there are equivalent commands for Windows systems, as well. Next, you should be familiar with some standard command line tools that are useful for processing text. These are commands like grep, sed and awk. These classic Linux and Unix commands extract information from the operating system, active processes and files. Be prepared to discuss how you can send the output from one command to another to produce complex reports from the CLI. If you're working with any sort of web-based application and system, you'll need to be familiar with tools that send and receive information over the network. Tools like ping, curl and netcat are great tools for sending web traffic in a way that allows precise control of the data being sent and also lends to automating reports using the data received. Also, the ssh suite of tools are useful for connecting to remote systems, transferring files between remote servers and your local file systems and other tasks that require communication over a network. And without a doubt, you should be familiar with how to access documentation from the command line. Sometimes you may be working on a remote system and can't access Google or Stack Overflow and you need to get some help with the command that you're running. Commands like info and man, which is short from manual, will be your best friends for getting details on commands that you may not use very often or that require some advanced options. And it's usually just faster to get this information from the command line, than switching to a web page and sorting through results to get the information you're looking for.

Scripting and programming
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Can you share some examples of a scripting language that you're most proficient with? - Scripting is an essential tool for DevOps. It's useful for automating any sort of process that needs to be repeated the same way every time. For this question, your first answer should be a resounding yes. Then, follow up with both the THX and story time methods. Here's an example. Yes, I've been using Python for nearly seven years now, and I've used it for automating deployment jobs and API interactions with AWS and Google Cloud. What I really like about Python is the easy-to-read syntax. I also like how it's easy to work with data in the JSON format. And also, I like how Python implements virtual environments for working with libraries. After using THX to establish your experience, move on to story time. If possible, align the experience you describe in your story with the skills and qualifications needed for the job. Probably the most complicated script I've written is a chat application. I wasn't very familiar with web development, and I learned a lot about using Django as a backend for a web application. I actually learned enough to write a lesson describing exactly what I did to implement the solution. If you need to get experience with scripting and programming, I want to share with you some languages that you should probably be familiar with. You definitely need to know Bash. On the Linux platform, Bash is one of the easiest ways to automate operations using system and CLI commands. If you're working in a Windows environment, the equivalent for this would be PowerShell. And these days, PowerShell runs on Linux, and Bash runs on Windows. So you can learn one or both of these shell languages and be effective on either platform. I really like Python for its simplicity and also for its ability to work with APIs and handle JSON data. Python is also widely used in data science, so if you're thinking about using DevOps in a role that requires data science, knowing Python will set you up nicely to work with data. Ruby is also a good scripting language to learn for working with configuration management tools. Both Puppet and Chef use Ruby as the language for their configurations. So being effective with these tools requires at least the ability to read Ruby. And if you become familiar with scripting with it, you can be even more proficient with these tools. And probably the most important programming language to be familiar with right now for people in DevOps roles is Go. Many modern applications are being developed in Go. So being familiar with this language will put you in a good position to know how to work with these applications. Also, Go can produce compiled executables for a variety of platforms, and these executables don't require any libraries or outside resources when they're run on the systems that they're deployed to. So you can write a tool in Go and share it very easily with other engineers without having to rewrite the application.

Software version control
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- What's your experience with version control tools? - During the software development cycle, source code is constantly being changed. Either new features are being added or bugs are being fixed. Version control tools are used to track those changes, and by far, the most popular version control tool is Git. Git is free and open source and is easily set up on premises or as a service with providers like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. To be a viable candidate, you really need to know how to be effective with Git, particularly from the command line. There are a few basic commands that you really need to know before your interview. Let's go over each of these at a high level. git init is used to create a new, empty repository on your workstation. You would use this as you are starting development on a project. git clone is used to clone an existing project. This command connects to a remote repository and pulls the source code down to your local system. Once you've started working on a project, either by initializing or cloning it, you would use the git add command to add new files, and then the git commit command to commit these files to your local copy of the repository. After your files are committed, you would use the git push command to send the local copy of the files to the remote repository. And if you're collaborating with someone, you would use the git pull command to pull any changes that they've submitted to the remote repository to your local copy of the project. Version control lends itself to the DevOps process by tracking changes, but it also facilitates communication between teams and even between automated processes. This is done with pull requests, also known as merge requests, and web hooks. Pull requests are used to merge code from one branch of a project into another branch. This is particularly useful when code is merged from a development branch into the master branch. Pull requests can use automation to run tests and other processes on the new code before adding it to the master branch. This prevents potentially bad code from entering the master branch and causing problems in a production environment. The best way to get experience with Git is to start using it on a daily basis. You can use it to track changes to your own personal projects or you can find an open source project on github.com and clone that repository. Then make changes, commits, and even do pull requests against your own repository. All of this practice will help build confidence for your interview.

Incident management
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Describe the worst incident that you've ever experienced, and tell me, how did you handle it? - During your career, it's inevitable that you will experience some sort of problem with a system or application. These are referred to as incidents. Incident management is the process of handling these problems. If you get a question like this, the interviewer may be trying to determine a few things: the scale of the systems that you've worked on, how you handle incidents, and how you apply what you've learned from an incident. One of the best ways to approach answering this question is to use the story time method. The beginning is when the incident happened, and should include what occurred, how the incident was detected, and the scale of the problem. The middle is what it took to determine what was actually going wrong, and figuring out how to resolve the problem, and the end is what it took to resolve the incident, and get things back to normal. As you wrap up the story, you should add what you learned from the situation, and what changes were made to prevent a similar incident from happening again in the future. When you think about the scale of the problems that you've seen, I want you to try to go as large as possible. Don't exaggerate if you haven't experienced a large-scale outage, but think about something larger than "my operating system crashed," or "I couldn't connect to the internet one day." Specifically, think about production systems that were running normally, and then due to some event, which definitely wasn't your fault, the situation normal was all messed up. If you're new in your career, you may not have seen incidents on the scale of Google or Facebook going offline, but try to recall an incident that affected production-level services. Once you have your incident in mind, use the story time method to tell the interviewer what happened. As you describe the incident, include details that describe your composure. You want to be able to describe that even though you might have been nervous, you were able to keep cool while working towards a resolution. If you work with a formal incident management process, describe the steps of the process, and the roles you assumed during the incident. Also, describe any communications you shared during and after the incident. What you want to convey to the interviewer is that you can confidently handle incidents, and resolve them quickly. As you wrap up your story, be sure to include

Architecting cloud solutions
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Can you tell me about your experience with solution architecture? - To answer this question effectively, you need to demonstrate your ability to translate business requirements into deliverable solutions. Essentially, solutions architects take an idea and turn it into an operationally correct blueprint. Typically, solutions architects have experience that's T-shaped. That is, they're very familiar with a wide range of technologies and have a deep expertise in one. So, when it comes to architecting solutions for the Cloud with a DevOps perspective, solutions architects need to be well versed in the Cloud's capabilities and its limitations. Because architects need to interface with a variety of teams, a strong ability to communicate is also key. They'll need to be able to understand business needs and translate them into specifications that technical teams can implement. And conversely, they'll also need to be able to explain technical concepts to audiences that may not be familiar with technical terms. The best way to answer this question is the story time method. If you've implemented solutions from idea to production, describe that experience. Give details on how you receive requirements and then use your experience to make architectural decisions. If you implemented the solution, include those details as well. To wrap up your story, describe how the project completed along with the result. If the results were positive, great. If not, explain what you learned and how you use that experience to build your body of architectural knowledge. Also, the leading cloud service providers provide certifications for architecting on their platforms. This includes AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect and Google Cloud Platform Professional Cloud Architect. While it's not a requirement to have one of these certifications to be a cloud solutions architect, it would help qualify your ability to build solutions on the specific platform. So, if you have a certification, be sure to let your interviewer know. It may be the difference that sets you apart from the pack.

Infrastructure as Code
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- What are some of the benefits of using infrastructure as code? Give me an example. - Let's answer this question by defining infrastructure as code. With infrastructure as code, engineers use code to describe the servers, load balancers, firewalls, and other resources that create a system to run an application. Now we can go into the specifics of the benefits, version control, consistency, automation, and reuse. Since infrastructure as code is essentially a text document, it can be stored in a repository and version control can be applied to it. This allows engineers to track changes to the code, which in turn allows changes to the infrastructure to be tracked as well. Using code also lends itself to software development practices, like testing and code reviews. When engineers create something, they usually follow a specification or some blueprint that explains what they're going to be building. But if the build is a manual process, one engineer may interpret the specification differently than another. By using infrastructure as code, the specification is explicitly defined in the code itself. That way the specification is interpreted consistently from one engineer to another, or even by different teams. Infrastructure as code also lends itself to scale in automation. A recipe for a system that needs 10 servers, for example, can be quickly changed to 1000 servers with a simple code change. And because the build process is similar to compiling software, infrastructure as code can be integrated into pipelines and other build systems that enable automation. Infrastructure as code also lends itself to modular design. Engineers can define a system piece by piece, picking and choosing the resources that they need. And like any other code, infrastructure as code can be shared and used again. Because each cloud provider is different, you may get infrastructure as code questions specifically on the provider the company is using. Based on your research for the position, you should know which technology you need to focus on. If we take a look at the top three, you'll see that AWS uses a service called CloudFormation, Google Cloud uses Deployment Manager Templates, and Azure uses Azure Resource Manager Templates. Terraform is a popular tool for infrastructure as code 



Web servers
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- If you're interviewing for a position that involves managing websites or web applications, you can expect to answer questions about web servers. You'll want to be able to speak with confidence about the most widely used web servers, Apache and NGINX. Most common questions around web servers are along the lines of Apache versus NGINX. You may be asked, "What are the pros and cons of using Apache over NGINX and vice versa?" Or, "Which web server do you prefer and why?" So you'll need to know a little bit about both servers, but the key to answering this question is knowing how Apache and NGINX can work together. In modern web stacks, the main benefit of using Apache is its ability to natively serve dynamic content. For example, a properly configured Apache server can serve PHP or Python code without having to interface with another application. However, Apache may use more and more resources under heavy load. NGINX is known for serving static content efficiently and with low resource utilization. However, it can't serve dynamic content. NGINX makes up for this, though, by functioning as a high-performance reverse proxy, serving dynamic content from other applications. The answer to the Apache versus NGINX question can be wrapped up by describing how an efficient implementation can use NGINX as a proxy for Apache. In this case, NGINX handles the static content and passes the dynamic request to Apache. In this configuration, static content is served quickly and efficiently by NGINX and Apache's resources are kept to manageable levels. I would also suggest you get comfortable with installing and configuring Apache or NGINX. Both are easy to install with package managers on modern Linux systems. If you need to get familiar with a web server quickly, I would suggest NGINX, simply because the configuration files are written in a format that looks a lot like code, so you might find it easier to follow than Apache's XML-based config files.

Databases
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- You'll find databases in many of the roles that use DevOps practices. By their nature, databases are key to storing all types of critical information for services and applications. So even if you're not interviewing to be a database administrator, it'll be useful to know a thing or two about databases. First, you should be familiar with relational databases and NoSQL databases. You may be asked, what's the difference between a relational database and a NoSQL database? Or what's the benefit of using a NoSQL database instead of a relational database? Let's start with the first one. All databases define the way they store data, this is referred to as a model or a schema. In relational databases, the model is similar to a spreadsheet. Data is stored in tables using rows and columns. Before a relational database can be used, the tables and columns need to be defined so the database application knows what kind of data will be stored in each row. In NoSQL databases, a schema isn't required to get started. The data model can change with each item stored in the database, and this is essentially the answer to the second question. Working with NoSQL databases has the benefit of allowing data to change over time. This can be very useful for new applications with changing requirements. Many changes to relational databases can be difficult if a column is no longer needed, for example, or if a new column needs to be added. For interviewing, knowing these facts is only the start. MySQL and PostgreSQL are popular relational databases, and MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. At the least, you should be able to install one of these database servers and set up a basic configuration.

Containers
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Can you tell me why containers are important for DevOps? To answer this question, let's first answer a few other questions to establish your knowledge on containers. What is a Dockerfile? What is a container image? And finally, what is a container? Okay, first things first. What is a Dockerfile? A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all of the commands a user would call on the command line to assemble an image. Using a Dockerfile, a developer can specify all of the steps needed to run a particular piece of software, and because Dockerfiles are simply text documents, they can be stored and tracked in revision control systems and shared between developers easily. Dockerfiles are pretty much the industry standard for defining container images, so it helps to know how to create a Dockerfile or at least read and understand them. This leads to our next question. What is a container image? The Dockerfile is used by a build process to create the container image. By running a command like Docker build, the commands in the Dockerfile are executed and an image gets created. The image contains everything you need to run the application. This can include run times, libraries, and configurations. The image is typically stored in an image registry. All of the major cloud providers offer private registries, and the most popular public registry is Docker Hub. And now the last question. What is a container? Simply put, container images are used to create containers. Sometimes the term image and container are used interchangeably, but the container is actually the system process that runs a given image. So now let's answer the question,

(energetic music) - Architecting an interior web application is a classic scenario for DevOps interviews. It gives the interviewer an idea of your knowledge of web services and how they can be connected to deliver a useful end result. In this scenario, you've also been asked to make sure the architecture is highly available and includes security as well. By adding these requirements it allows the interviewer to see if you understand high availability 

Asking questions

- Do you have any questions for me? This could be one of the most important questions asked during your interview, and you should absolutely, positively answer yes. This is your opportunity to drive the interview. If you've done your research and took some notes during the interview, you should have several questions to choose from. Be sure to tailor your questions to the person you're interviewing with. Also try to ask open-ended questions that allow room for explanations instead of a simple yes or no answer. If you're interviewing with your contact in human resources or a recruiter, you may want to ask specific questions about benefits, company culture, and general topics about working for the company. For example, you might ask about the performance review cycle or the timing for your first review. If you're interviewing with potential team members, you can ask more technical questions or ask for details about their day-to-day work. One good question for peer-level interviews is, "What's the most pressing technical challenge that your team is facing right now?" If your skills and experience line up with their response, you may be able to get one more opportunity to show how you could be a benefit to the team. If you're speaking to the hiring manager, you want to ask specific questions about any concerns they might have for your capability to do the job. You can phrase this as, "Do you have any reservations about my qualifications, or is there anything about my skills or experience that you'd like to know more about?" If they do have any reservations, this is the perfect time for you to provide additional information. If any questions arise after their interview, they may hesitate to reach out to you and instead opt for another candidate. In any of these scenarios, try to maintain eye contact with your interviewer and jot down notes so you can recall their answers after the interview.

Following up

- I can't emphasize enough the importance of following up after an interview. By keeping in touch with your interviewers, you can show that you have a continued interest in the opportunity. Start with a thank you note. Get a thank you card and include a handwritten note. Yes, get a card, an envelope, and a stamp, and put it in a mailbox. The best time to do this is immediately after an interview on your way home. The note doesn't have to be long, it just needs to include the interviewer's name and a brief message thanking them for their time and the opportunity to interview for the position. You can keep the conversation open-ended by mentioning that you look forward to hearing from them. Sending a thank you card may be easy if you're interviewing with a company where everyone is housed in the same location, and you can get the address. It may be more difficult in situations where you're interviewing in a location away from the office or interviewing over video teleconference. In those cases, send an email directly to the interviewer or reach out to them through your recruiter or your primary contact with the company. After you nail the interview, sending a follow-up note could be the act that seals the deal on your new job.
