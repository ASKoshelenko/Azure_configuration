  ‚úÖ **Q35**  
**Question:**  
You have an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) pod.  
You need to configure a probe to perform the following actions:  
- Confirm that the pod is responding to service requests.  
- Check the status of the pod four times a minute.  
- Initiate a shutdown if the pod is unresponsive.  

How should you complete the YAML configuration file? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.  

**Answer Area:**  
**Box 1:** `readinessProbe:` ‚úÖ  
üëâ This probe checks if the pod is ready to serve traffic. It confirms whether the application is available for requests.  

**Box 2:** `periodSeconds: 15` ‚úÖ  
üëâ This means the probe will check the pod's readiness every 15 seconds, which is four times a minute (60 / 15 = 4).  

**Explanation:**  
- `readinessProbe` is used to determine when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.  
- `periodSeconds` defines how frequently (in seconds) to perform the probe.  
- Shutdown or restart logic can be implemented by Kubernetes based on probe failure.
