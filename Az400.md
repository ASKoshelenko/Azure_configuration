  ✅ **Q35**  
**Question:**  
You have an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) pod.  
You need to configure a probe to perform the following actions:  
- Confirm that the pod is responding to service requests.  
- Check the status of the pod four times a minute.  
- Initiate a shutdown if the pod is unresponsive.  

How should you complete the YAML configuration file? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.  

**Answer Area:**  
**Box 1:** `readinessProbe:` ✅  
👉 This probe checks if the pod is ready to serve traffic. It confirms whether the application is available for requests.  

**Box 2:** `periodSeconds: 15` ✅

✅ Q140  
**English (Original):**  
140) Your team uses an agile development approach.
You need to recommend a branching strategy for the team's Git repository. The strategy must meet the following requirements.
⟹ Provide the ability to work on multiple independent tasks in parallel.
⟹ Ensure that checked-in code remains in a releasable state always.
⟹ Ensure that new features can be abandoned at any time.
⟹ Encourage experimentation.
What should you recommend?

A. a single long-running branch without forking
B. multiple long-running branches
C. a single fork per team member
D. a single long-running branch with multiple short-lived feature branches ✅

Topic/feature branches, however, are useful in projects of any size. A topic branch is a short-lived branch that you create and use for a single particular feature or related work. This is something you've likely never done with a VCS before because it's generally too expensive to create and merge branches. But in Git it's common to create, work on, merge, and delete branches several times a day.

---

**Русский (Перевод):**  
140) Ваша команда использует гибкий подход к разработке.
Вам нужно рекомендовать стратегию ветвления для Git-репозитория команды. Стратегия должна соответствовать следующим требованиям.
⟹ Обеспечить возможность работы над несколькими независимыми задачами параллельно.
⟹ Обеспечить, чтобы зафиксированный код всегда оставался в состоянии, пригодном для выпуска.
⟹ Обеспечить возможность отказа от новых функций в любое время.
⟹ Поощрять экспериментирование.
Что вы должны рекомендовать?

A. одну долгоживущую ветку без форкинга
B. несколько долгоживущих веток
C. один форк на каждого члена команды
D. одну долгоживущую ветку с несколькими недолговечными ветками функций ✅

Тематические ветки/ветки функций, однако, полезны в проектах любого размера. Тематическая ветка — это недолговечная ветка, которую вы создаете и используете для одной конкретной функции или связанной работы. Это то, что вы, вероятно, никогда не делали с системой контроля версий ранее, потому что обычно создание и слияние веток слишком затратно.

Вам нужно, чтобы Azure DevOps отправлял уведомление в Jenkins, когда разработчик фиксирует изменения в ветке в Azure Repos.
Решение: Вы создаете подписку на хук службы, который использует событие завершения сборки.
Соответствует ли это цели?

A. Да
B. Нет ✅

Вы можете создать хук службы для Azure DevOps Services и TFS с Jenkins.
Однако событие подписки службы должно использовать событие отправки кода (code pushed event), которое запускается, когда код отправляется в репозиторий Git.


✅ Q142  
**English (Original):**  
142) You have a project in Azure DevOps that has a release pipeline.
You need to integrate work item tracking and an Agile project management system to meet the following requirements:
⟹ Ensure that developers can track whether their commits are deployed to production.
⟹ Report the deployment status.
⟹ Minimize integration effort.
Which system should you use?

A. Asana
B. Basecamp
C. Trello
D. Jira ✅

Jira Software is a development tool used by agile teams to plan, track, and manage software releases. Using Azure Pipelines, teams can configure CI/CD pipelines for applications of any language, deploying to any platform or cloud.
Note: Microsoft and Atlassian have partnered together to build an integration between Azure Pipelines and Jira Software. This integration connects the tools supporting full tracking of how and when value envisioned with an issue is delivered to end users. This enables teams to setup a tight development cycle from issue creation through release. Key development milestones like builds and deployments associated to a Jira issue can then be tracked from within Jira.

142) У вас есть проект в Azure DevOps, который имеет пайплайн релиза.
Вам нужно интегрировать отслеживание рабочих элементов и систему управления Agile-проектами, чтобы соответствовать следующим требованиям:
⟹ Обеспечить разработчикам возможность отслеживать, развернуты ли их коммиты в продакшн.
⟹ Сообщать о статусе развертывания.
⟹ Минимизировать усилия по интеграции.
Какую систему следует использовать?

A. Asana
B. Basecamp
C. Trello
D. Jira ✅

Jira Software — это инструмент разработки, используемый гибкими командами для планирования, отслеживания и управления выпусками программного обеспечения. Используя Azure Pipelines, команды могут настраивать CI/CD пайплайны для приложений любого языка, с развертыванием на любой платформе или в облаке.
Примечание: Microsoft и Atlassian объединились для создания интеграции между Azure Pipelines и Jira Software. Эта интеграция соединяет инструменты, обеспечивающие полное отслеживание того, как и когда ценность, предусмотренная в задаче, доставляется конечным пользователям. Это позволяет командам настроить тесный цикл разработки от создания задачи до выпуска. Ключевые этапы разработки, такие как сборки и развертывания, связанные с задачей Jira, затем могут отслеживаться из Jira.
