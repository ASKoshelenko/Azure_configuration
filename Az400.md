✅ **Q33**  
**Question:**  
You plan to create alerts that will be triggered based on the page load performance of a home page.  
You have the Application Insights log query shown in the exhibit.  
Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.  

**Statement 1:**  
To create an alert based on the page load experience of most users, the alerting level must be based on:  
**A. percentile_duration_50**  
**B. percentile_duration_90**  
**C. percentile_duration_95** ✅

To only create an alert when authentication error occurs on the server, the query must be filtered on:  
**A. item Type**  
**B. resultCode**  
**C. source**  
**D. success** ✅

**Explanation:**  
- `percentile_duration_95` is used to alert based on the experience of the slowest 5% of users, which helps catch outliers in performance.  
- `success == false` is the correct filter to detect failed requests like authentication errors.

**References:**  
- [Alerts Based on Analytics Query](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/alerts-based-on-analytics-query-using-custom-log-search/)

  ✅ **Q35**  
**Question:**  
You have an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) pod.  
You need to configure a probe to perform the following actions:  
- Confirm that the pod is responding to service requests.  
- Check the status of the pod four times a minute.  
- Initiate a shutdown if the pod is unresponsive.  

How should you complete the YAML configuration file? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.  

**Answer Area:**  
**Box 1:** `readinessProbe:` ✅  
👉 This probe checks if the pod is ready to serve traffic. It confirms whether the application is available for requests.  

**Box 2:** `periodSeconds: 15` ✅  
👉 This means the probe will check the pod's readiness every 15 seconds, which is four times a minute (60 / 15 = 4).  

**Explanation:**  
- `readinessProbe` is used to determine when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.  
- `periodSeconds` defines how frequently (in seconds) to perform the probe.  
- Shutdown or restart logic can be implemented by Kubernetes based on probe failure.
