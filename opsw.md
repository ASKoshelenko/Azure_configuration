### INTRODUCTION / SELF-PRESENTATION

**Extended Version (3-4 minutes):**

"Hello! I'm Alex, a DevOps engineer with a strong background in cloud technologies and infrastructure automation. I'm currently holding several key cloud certifications: Google Cloud Professional DevOps Engineer, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and Azure Fundamentals. I'm particularly proud to be ranked in the top 1000 specialists worldwide in the Google Skill Boost Challenge 2024.

In my current role at EPAM Systems, I'm working on the Robert Bosch GmbH project, where I've implemented CI/CD pipelines and automated cloud infrastructure deployment using Azure and Terraform. I've significantly reduced deployment time by 70% through infrastructure optimization and automation. I also developed backup solutions for Commercetools data using Azure Logic Apps and set up cross-team collaboration through GitLab-Bitbucket mirroring.

One of my recent achievements was leading the infrastructure development for EPAM's IT Marathon project, where I architected core Terraform infrastructure and presented solutions to 500+ students. I also contributed to the AWS Security project, where I successfully migrated 50+ Lambda functions and implemented test scenarios for security challenge assessment.

I have extensive experience with various DevOps tools and practices, including:
- Container orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Ansible
- CI/CD implementations with Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Monitoring solutions using Grafana, Zabbix, and Prometheus

I'm particularly interested in joining OpsWorks because of your strong presence in AWS solutions and the opportunity to work on challenging projects in various industries. I believe my experience in cloud infrastructure and automation would be valuable for your team."
